# plex-open-playlister
Plex Open Playlister is a custom, self-hosted app replacing the standard Plex AI integration. It generates intelligent playlists using alternative LLMs like Gemini or local Ollama models. Fetches your library, curates tracks from your prompts, and auto-creates the playlist. Ideal for Raspberry Pi and self-hosted users seeking full control.
